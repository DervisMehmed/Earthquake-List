# Earthquake-List

It is an application that takes data from service and lists earthquakes. The data is retrieved from Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute's website and loaded into the service.

The application periodically refreshes itself and shows the current earthquakes. Clicking the each item shows the information about earthquake and demonsrates its location at Google Maps.
